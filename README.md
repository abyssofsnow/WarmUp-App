Given the problem space of college campus, we decided to tackle gym insecurity, with our target audience being college students who are gym novices wishing to improve their physical health, particularly in a gym setting. 
The application allows a user to scan a machine and get detailed instructions on how to use it, curate personalized workout routines with suggested exercises, and join a health-oriented online community of individuals to motivate and to alleviate the anxiety that comes with navigating the gym.
